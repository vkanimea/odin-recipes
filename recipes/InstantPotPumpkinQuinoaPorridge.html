    <h2>Desciption</h2>
    <p>If you haven't tried quinoa for breakfast yet, you're missing out on a tasty and comforting way to start your day. Quinoa will give you a hefty serving of protein, and the warm and spicy pumpkin in this recipe will give you lots of added vitamins and fiber. This is prepared in the Instant PotÂ®, which makes it quick and easy too! I made mine without too much sweetener and lots of spice; adjust the amounts to your taste. Leftovers will keep in the refrigerator up to 6 days</p>
